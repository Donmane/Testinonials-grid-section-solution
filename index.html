I needed some sort of structure f4rom professionals who can help me learn programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former student of theirs who can only say wounderful things about the program. The entire currlculum and staff did not disapoint. They were very hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance. The agile team project, in particular was outstanding. It took my learning to the next level in a way that no tutoruial could ever have.In fact, I've often referred to It during It certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack developer after recieving mulitiple offers.100% recommend!
